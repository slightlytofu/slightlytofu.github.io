## 简介

带着好意出发，却可能在动权倡导的路上不慎「踩雷」。当来自西方的动保策略被复制粘贴到亚洲，为何常常水土不服，甚至对本土运动造成伤害？这背后，触及了近年来动权领域两个至关重要的议题：**去殖民化** (decolonization) ——即深刻反思并挑战以西方为中心的动物倡导模式；以及**全面解放** (total liberation) ——坚信人类解放与动物解放不可分割。围绕着这些复杂的议题，在本期节目中，我们邀请了来自世界各地的动物权利倡导者，一起坦诚地聊聊 Ta 们在运动中见过或犯过的那些错误。

节目的前半部分，一位深耕亚洲本土动权倡导的匿名嘉宾，深入剖析了国际组织在扩张时常犯的错误和全面解放的重要性。来自哥伦比亚的倡导者费尔南多分享了更为具体的教训，回忆早期运动如何错误地将农场动物的困境与哥伦比亚社会中极为敏感的人类绑架议题相提并论，并分享了促使哥伦比亚禁止斗牛娱乐的关键事件。节目的后半段，我们转向了更个人化、更关注社群内部建设的思考。有着亚洲血统和非洲生活经历的英国倡导者查尔斯，分享了自己曲折的动权之路。

以上就是本期节目的上集。通过三位嘉宾的分享，我们得以一窥在亚洲和拉丁美洲等全球南方地区，动权倡导所面临的独特文化困境与挑战。在节目的下集，我们将会把目光转向欧洲。那里有着历史更为悠久的动物权利运动，其行动策略也常常聚焦于更为直接的抗争。我们邀请了几位奋斗在欧洲前线的动权倡导者，来谈谈在不同的法律体系和社群环境下，Ta 们对犯错这个主题又有哪些不一样的观察与反思。敬请期待。

What begins with the best of intentions can sometimes lead to missteps in animal advocacy. When strategies from the West are "copy-pasted" into Asia, why do they so often fail to translate, or worse, cause real harm to the local movement? This question touches upon two crucial themes that have become central to the animal rights discourse in recent years: **decolonization**—a call to deeply question and challenge Western-centric models of advocacy; and **total liberation**—the conviction that human and animal liberation are inseparable. Navigating these complex ideas, this episode brings together advocates from around the world for a candid conversation about the mistakes they've witnessed or made in the movement.

In the first half of the show, an anonymous guest with deep roots in local Asian animal advocacy analyzes two critical mistakes that international organizations often make when expanding. First, blindly applying successful Western models while ignoring Asia’s unique cultural, political, and local contexts. Second, operating within a top-down management structure where strategic decisions are made by Western managers who lack local experience, leading to burnout among local activists, sometimes even causing them to leave the movement. Fernando, an animal rights advocate from Colombia, shares more concrete lessons. He recalls how the early movement mistakenly equated the plight of farm animals with the highly sensitive issue of human kidnapping in Colombian society. This appropriation not only came across as tone-deaf but also directly offended and alienated potential allies. He also shares the story of how Colombia abolished bullfighting as entertainment and the key events that led to this victory.

In the latter half of this episode, we shift to more personal reflections and a focus on internal community building. Charles, a UK-based advocate of Asian heritage with life experience in Africa, shares his own winding journey in advocacy. His childhood experiences of witnessing animal slaughter in the Philippines and Nigeria left a profound impact on him. However, to avoid friction with friends and family, he initially used "health" as a shield for practicing veganism, until a moment of physical revulsion during a meal led him to truly embrace his ethical stance. Today, he chooses to channel his energy into more concrete and tangible actions, like fundraising for animal sanctuaries.

This concludes the first half of our episode. Through the stories of our anonymous guest, Fernando, and Charles, we've glimpsed the unique cultural dilemmas and challenges faced by advocates in the Global South, from Asia to Latin America. In the second half, we will turn our focus to Europe. There, the animal rights movement has a much longer history, and its strategies often center on more direct forms of action. We've invited more advocates from the front lines in Europe to discuss their different perspectives and reflections on the theme of making mistakes within different legal systems and community environments. Stay tuned.
